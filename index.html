            member of the family of string instruments that includes the viola and cello. It is the smallest
            member of the family with the highest pitch, and it often used as a solo instrument in 
            Western orchestras. It is tuned in fourths
            and is one of the most popular string instruments of Western music. Violins are also called "fiddles"
            in Bluegrass music and other folk musical genres.

            16th-century Italian string instruments, but it didn't look like it does today until 19th century. 
            In Europe, it served as the basis 
            for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the 
            viola. The violin itself was developed after the viola da gamba, an older Western string instrument.

          <p class="description-text"><span class="emphasized">Description: </span> The bass viola da gamba is the largest and lowest-sounding instrument in the viola da gamba, also called “viol,” family. It is used as a solo instrument and in ensembles called “viol consorts.” While there are three other popular members of the viol family, the bass gamba has the most existing solo repertoire. Viols are fretted halfway down the fingerboard, meaning they can only play pitches of the Western diatonic scale until the frets stop, where they can play any pitch in the range of the instrument. It is held between the legs while being played.

          <p class="history-text"><span class="emphasized">History: </span>The viola da gamba family as we know it today wasn’t fully developed until the 16th century, but it hasn’t undergone any major changes since then. The instrument family was popular in the Baroque period of Western music, but had died out until a recent resurgence in popularity in the late 20th century. Since modern musicians value the instruments antiquity, gut strings (strings made from sheep or cat intestines,) are used, giving the instrument a softer and more mellow tone than the violin family.

There are other Chinese bowed string instrument families, but the erhu is one of the most popular bowed string instruments in any of the families. The erhu is played with a bow like the other instruments on this page, but for the erhu the strings are between the bow hair and the bow, unlike other instruments that separate the bow and the instrument. The erhu is played by stopping the strings with just your fingers rather than fingers pressed against a board, which gives it a more harmonically dense and airy tone than the violin.

          <p class="history-text"><span class="emphasized">History: </span>The erhu existed as early as the 11th century in china, but it has roots ranging all the way back to the mid-8th century. Modifications and standardization came to the instrument in the 20th century, giving it steel and nylon strings. While the instrument has been adjusted to increase its volume and authenticity it still closely resembles its near-ancient predecessors.

It’s played resting between the legs while the musician sits. The masenqo is unique on this list because it only has one string. However, it can still play a wide range of pitches because of its lack of a fingerboard. The string on a masenqo is made of horsehair, which gives it a woody and airy tone.

          <p class="history-text"><span class="emphasized">History: </span>The masenqo and other one-stringed instruments are thought to have have roots in instruments that were traded between western African groups and Middle-Eastern groups as early as the 4th century. As such an old instrument, it’s hard to pin down what changes could have been made over the years. Either way, the materials used to construct the masenqo today could have been obtained as early as humans had access to trading routes and domesticated horses.

The instrument is often used by musicians to accompany themselves during the singing of tales or urryn duu (meaning long songs.) They can also be used as solo instruments in compositions called tatlaga. Khuur instruments are instantly identifiable from the scroll, which are carved in the shape of a horses head. One of the unique traditional uses of the morin khuur is to persuade livestock to suckle previously rejected calves.

The morin khuur was once tuned in 5ths, but it is now more commonly tuned in 4ths, giving it approximately a three octave range. Instruments of the khuur family have also adopted the violin family’s style of sound holes called “f holes” because of their resemblance to the letter “f.”
